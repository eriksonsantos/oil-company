This software was developed for a final work on Real Time Automation. The purpose of this work is to apply the knowledge of concurrent and parallel programming in the Windows environment. In this sense, a Multithread and Multiprogramming architecture was implemented, in which these software communicate through Pipes, file mapped in memory and file on disk. Thus, it was possible to use the resources of the Windows API (CreateProcess, WaitForSingleObject, CreateMutex, CreateSemaphore) among others.
